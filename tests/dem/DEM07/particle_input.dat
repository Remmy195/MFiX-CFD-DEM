Instructions:
Dimension: Enter "2" for 2D, "3" for 3D (Integer)
Particles: Number of particles to read from this file (Integer)
For each variable, enter whether it will be read from the file
("T" to be read (True), "F" to not be read (False)). When not read, enter the
default values assign to all particles.
Coordinates are always read (X,Y in 2D, X,Y,Z in 3D)
Phase_ID, Diameter, Density, Temperature are scalars
Velocity requires U,V in 2D, U,V,W in 3D
Temperature is only read/set if the energy equation is solved
Species are only read/set if the species equations are solved, and requires 
all species to be set (if phase 1 has 2 species and phase 2 has 4 species,
all particles must have 4 entries, even phase 1 particles (pad list with zeros)
User scalars need DES_USR_VAR_SIZE values
Data starts at line 35. Each column correspond to a variable.
