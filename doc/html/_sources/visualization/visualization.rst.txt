Visualization in GUI
====================

As a means to demonstrate visualization techniques with the MFiX GUI,
references within this section are associated with the ``dem/hopper_3d`` case.
We advise loading and running this project to get familiar with the
results visualization techniques.

The ``dem/hopper_3d`` case will take several minutes to run. On the
:ref:`run-pane` Pane, you can see that the Stop time is 5.0 seconds.

-  Click on the |add| (new) button in the upper right corner of the window.
-  Click on the |geometry| (VTK) button to create a new :ref:`vtk-tabs`.

You should see the particles for the 3D Hopper case.

-  Click the |play| (play) button in the middle of the top of the VTK results window.

If you don't see any change, wait a few minutes for more output files to be written.

-  Click the |first| (first) button to play the visualization from the beginning.
