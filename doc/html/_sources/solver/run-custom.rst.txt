=================================
Running Custom Interactive Solver
=================================

First :ref:`build a custom solver <build-custom>`.


.. _run-custom-gui:

Running custom solver from GUI
------------------------------

After building the custom solver, run a simulation by pressing |play| (Run) to
display the :ref:`run-dialog`. Select the mfixsolver file you have just built.

You can pause, unpause, stop, or get info from the solver.


.. _run-custom-cmdline:

Running custom solver from command line
---------------------------------------

As an example, the ``tfm/silane_pyrolysis_2d`` tutorial has UDFs and will not run with the
default solver.

After :ref:`building the solver <build-custom>`, on a Linux or Mac system, run the custom solver with the command:

.. code-block:: shell

    ~/projectdir> ./mfixsolver -f SP2D.mfx

Use ``./`` in front of mfixsolver to use the solver in the project directory, not the default solver in your ``PATH``.


On Windows, run the custom solver in the project directory with:

.. code-block:: shell

    C:\projectdir > mfixsolver -f SP2D.mfx

.. include:: /icons.rst
