Fluid
=====

The fluid pane is used to select the models and parameters defining the
fluid phase. The fluid pane is only accessible if the fluid phase is
being solved.

**Name**
The name used to refer to the continuous phase in the GUI. By default,
the continuous phase is termed "fluid", However, it may be renamed for
convenience.

Fluid Model Options
-------------------

**Solve momentum equation**
By default, all momentum equations are solved. Individual momentum
equations may be disabled by toggling the check box.

**Solve species equations**
By default, species transport equations are not solved for the fluid
phase. If species equations are enabled, species will need to be
added to the fluid phase using the fluid species tool.

**Enable scalar equations**
By default, no additional scalar transport equations are solved with
the fluid phase. Additional scalars may be added by toggling the
scalar checkbox and specifying the number of additional scalars to
track.

**Energy equations** Energy equations cannot be enabled or disabled on
a per-phase basis. As such, they are enabled or disabled for all
phases in the Model setup pane.

**Reference pressure** has units of :math:`(Pa)` and is zero by default. A
constant value may be specified to shift the simulation pressure prior
to scaling.


**Pressure scale factor** is dimensionless and is one by default. A

.. math::

   P_{scaled} = {P_{simulation} - P_{reference}}/{P_{scale factor}}


Fluid species
-------------------

Species that comprise the fluid phase are summarized in the species overview
table. New species are added by clicking the add button, |add|, at the top
of the species table, and selecting one or
more valid regions (see :numref:`ic_region_select`).
