Monitors
^^^^^^^^

A Monitor is a tool for capturing data from the solver about the model.

Data (such as volume fraction, pressure, velocity, etc.) for a given
:ref:`monitor_region` is written to a :ref:`CSV file <monitor_filename>`
while the solver is running.

The number of monitors that can be defined for a project is limited to a maximum
of 100.

.. _monitor_region:

Region selection
----------------

To define a monitor, there must be a region already defined in the :ref:`Regions
Pane <regions>`. Click the |add| button at the top, which will open a popup
window for selecting the region. A Monitor region is a single point, plane, or
volume. Multiple regions cannot be combined for a monitor, and STL regions
cannot be used for monitors.


.. _monitor_filename:

Monitor Output
--------------

Filename
   The monitor output file will have a default name based on the name of the
   monitor's region. You can edit the filename of a monitor by selecting the
   monitor from the list of monitors and changing "Filename base". The monitor data
   will be output to the Filename base with the extension ``.csv``.

   The monitor output file is in Comma Separated Value (CSV) format. The first line
   of the file provides header information. For example, running the Silane
   Pyrolysis tutorial (SP2D) will generate a file ``PROBE_SPECIES.csv``:

   .. code:: text

       #
       # Run type: NEW
       # "Time","x_g(1)","x_g(2)","x_g(3)","x_g(4)","x_g(5)","x_s(1,1)","x_s(1,2)"
           0.0000000    ,    0.0000000    ,    0.0000000    ,    0.0000000    ,    0.0000000    ,    1.0000000    ,    0.0000000    ,    1.0000000


Write Interval
   The write interval defines how frequently the monitor data will be written to
   the output file. It has a default value of 0.05 seconds of simulation time.


After creating a monitor, use the menus and check boxes to select one or more variables.


Eulerian Monitors
-----------------

The monitor variables available for the fluid phase are:


   -  Volume fraction (of all fluid species)
   -  Fluid Pressure
   -  Fluid Velocity
   -  Fluid Temperature
   -  Turbulent Kinetic Energy
   -  Turbulent Dissipation
   -  Volume fraction of each individual fluid species


The variables available for TFM solids include:


   -  Velocity of this solid phase

There is a monitor variable available for each scalar defined on
the :ref:`scalar_pane` tab.


There is a monitor variable available for each reaction defined on
the :ref:`chemical_reactions` tab.


There are different types of monitors available. A monitor type applies an operator
(for example a sum, an area integral or a volume integral) to the variable.
The dimensionality of the region determines which operators can be applied.

Flow rates
~~~~~~~~~~

Flow rate monitors for Lagrangian particles (DEM/PIC) are only valid for area
(plane) regions. The set of particles crossing the flow plane, :math:`\Gamma`

   the flow plane, :math:`\Gamma`.

   .. math:: \sum_{p \in \Gamma} w_p \phi_p \frac{v_p}{\left| v_p \right|}

Mass-weighted flow rate
   The net mass-weighted flow rate is the sum of the general particle property
   :math:`\phi_p` multiplied by the particle mass, :math:`m_p` of the set of
   particles projected to have crossed the flow plane, :math:`\Gamma`.

   .. math:: \sum_{p \in \Gamma} w_p m_p \phi_p \frac{v_p}{\left| v_p \right|}
