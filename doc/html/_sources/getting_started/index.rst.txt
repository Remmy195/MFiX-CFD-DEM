This section explains how to install the MFiX package on Linux, Windows,
or MacOS, using the Miniforge package system. There are three steps overall
to the MFiX installation process:

  #. Create an account at https://mfix.netl.doe.gov
  #. Download and install Miniforge
  #. Install MFiX, using Miniforge's "conda" installer

Step 3 requires registration and a login account. MFiX is an open-source
multiphase flow solver and is free to download and use. A one-time no-cost
registration is required prior to downloading the software. To register, go to
https://mfix.netl.doe.gov/register and submit your account information. Your
application will be manually reviewed and accepted, so please allow for 2-3
business days for your registration to be processed. You will receive a
confirmation email when you can login.
