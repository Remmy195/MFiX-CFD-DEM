Advanced Tutorials
------------------

The following tutorials demonstrate advanced features that can be implemented
with user defined files (UDFs). They require editing Fortran source files
(``usr_*.f`` or other ``*.f`` files) and building the custom solver.

- Reacting flows

  - Silane Pyrolysis (2D TFM): Setup TFM reaction rates.
  - Silane Pyrolysis (3D PIC): Setup PIC/DEM reaction rates.
  - Absorption column (2D TFM): Setup TFM reaction rates and user-defined properties.

- Transient keyframe data

  - Pulsating fluidized bed (TFM): Impose fluctuating inlet velocity.
  - Rotating drum (Granular DEM): Impose tangential velocity to wall.
  - Conveyor belts (Granular DEM): Impose tangential velocity to wall.
  - Screwfeeder (Granular DEM): Control a group of particles to represent moving geometry.
  - Mixer (Granular DEM): Control velocity of an Internal surface.
  - Mixer (Granular PIC): Control velocity of an Internal surface.
